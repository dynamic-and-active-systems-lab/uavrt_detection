function [xout] = fftshiftstft(x)
%FFTSHIFTSTFT Performs a standard fftshift operation but accounts for the
%different frequency range definition in Matlabs STFT function when
%outputing a 'centered' frequency range
%   When calling the STFT function, the default output for frequency is
%   the 'centered' method where frequencies are reported on the range of
%   (-n/2+1:n/2)*Fs/n if the vector is of even length and
%   (ceil(-n/2):floor(n/2))*Fs/n if the vector is of odd length. It seems
%   that Matlab's fftshift function is develped for frequencies in the
%   range of (-n/2:n/2+1)*Fs/n if the vector is of even length. The odd
%   length definition is unaffected. The result is an incorrect shifting of
%   the frequency vector if fftshift is used on f defined by stft's
%   centered method. This function uses the fftshift command for vectors
%   of even length, but shifts the result by 1 to the left to correct for
%   this problem. 
%   
%   If x is a matrix, it is assumed that the matrix is formatted similar to
%   the output of a STFT call, wherein the rows represent the different
%   frequencies and the rows are the time windows. As such, in this case
%   the rows are operated on (shifted). 
%
%INPUTS:
%   x       nxm     A matrix of real or complex data. If passed a matrix,
%                   the rows should represent frequency bins
%OUTPUT:
%   xout    nxm     A matrix of real or complex shifted data
