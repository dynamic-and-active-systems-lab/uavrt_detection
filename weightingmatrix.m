function [W,Wf] = weightingmatrix(x_of_n_in,Fs,zetas,frequencyRangeType)
%WEIGHTINGMATRIX Builds the spectral weighting matrix for the incoherent
%summationation algorithm. The matrix is based on the DFT coefficients
%developed from the waveform passed to the function. The function first
%developeds a weighting vectors based on an unaltered waveform, but then
%shifts the waveforms spectral content base fractions of the DFT bin width,
%as defined by the zetas input. These shifted waveforms then have their
%DFT's computed. The original and shifted DFT coefficients are then aligned
%in a matrix. In this way, this weighting matrix allows for the dominant
%frequency in the vector it weights to be between bins. This submatrix is
%then row shifted and concantinated a number of times so that the DFT
%coefficients are shifted across all DFT frequency bins. The outputs are 
%the weighting matrix W and a frequency vector Wf that corresponds to the 
%rows of W. The frequencies, and therefore the rows of the W matrix, use a
%centered frequency definitions defined by the STFT.m algorithm. 
%
%   Example:   [W,Wf] = weightingmatrix(rand(1,10),1,[0 0.5])
% 
%   INPUTS:
%   x_of_n      nx1     Vector of discrete data sampled as Fs. Can be 1xn.
%   Fs          1x1     Sampling rate in Hz of the dataset
%   zetas       mx1     A vector of fractions of the DFT frequency bin
%                       width for which to compute and include in the
%                       spectral weighting matrix output. If no interbin
%                       shifting is desired, enter 0. Range of inputs
%                       [0,1).
%   frequencyRangeType  String of either 'centered' or 'twosided'. See
%                       stft.m documentation on details of these frequency
%                       bounds. If 'centered' is selected, the zero
%                       frequency point is near the center of the output
%                       matrix. If 'twosided' is selected, the zero
%                       frequency points is in the upper left corner of the
%                       output W matrix. 
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%   W           nxnm    A matrix of spectral weighting vectors along each
%                       column. The hermitian of this matrix is designed to
%                       be multiplied by a vector of DFT coefficients. The 
%                       weights held in column p can be thought of as the
%                       matched DFT coefficients if the signal were to have
%                       been shifted by the template by Wf(p). 
%   Wf          nmx1    A matrix of the frequency shifts corresponding to
%                       each column of W 
%
%
% The intended use of the W matrix is to multiply it's hermetian by a FFT 
% vector, or STFT matrix with frequencies in the rows. 
%          
%
%   [W^h]*S         or          [W^h]*FFT
%
% The outputs of this multiplication will have n*m rows. The rows of the
% result there for are the "scores" of at frequency associated with that
% row. The row frequencies are dependent on the zetas. Consider an input
% series that had frequencies [-100 0 100 200]. If the zeta input was 
% [0 0.5], weightings for full and half frequencies steps would be 
% developed.

%               -150    [                           ]
%               -100    [                           ]
%               -50     [                           ]
%               0       [            W^h            ]
%               50      [                           ]
%               100     [                           ]
%               150     [                           ]
%               200     [                           ]

%   The first row of the matrix above would contain the weightings for the
%   -100 0 100 and 200 Hz frequencie bins if the FFT (or STFT time window)
%   had a signal at -150 Hz. Similarly, the second row would contain the 
%   weightings for the -100 0 100 and 200 Hz frequencie bins if the FFT 
%   (or STFT time window) had a signal at -100 Hz.

%% Change Log
% 2022-01-12    Updated to include twosided frequency range for output and
%               updated the code associated with generating the unsorted W
%               matrix to increase speed. Added use of makestftFreqVector
%               function.
