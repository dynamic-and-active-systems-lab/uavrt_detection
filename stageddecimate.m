function [x] = stageddecimate(xin,Fsraw,Fsdec) %#codegen
%STAGEDDECIMATE Decimates the input vector in stages in accordance
%with the limit suggested by decimate.m, where factors greater than 13
%should be decimated in stages.
%   The Matlab function decimate.m states that if the decimation factor is
%   greater than 13, the decimation factor should be divided and done in
%   stages. This function does this staged decimation. If reviews the
%   requested decimation factor and proceeds to decimate using factors of
%   the decimation, attempting at each stages to decimate by the largest
%   factor to avoid unesseary decimation steps:
%
%INPUTS: 
%   xin     A column (Nx1) vector of data to be decimated. Maximum length is
%           10e6. If a matrix is entered, each column will be independently
%           decimated. 
%   Fsraw   Sample rate of x input
%   Fsdec   Desired sample rate of output
%   Fsdec   Desired sample rate of output
%
%OUTPUTS
%   x   The decimated vector of input as requested sample rate
