%The max element of the ppm for K>1 is (K-1)*(N+M)+J+1 which is the latest 
%possible index of the Kth pulse if the first arrived at n = 1. 
%
%The max element of the ppm for K=1 is 1 which is the first possible index
%of the 1st pulse. 
%
%The size of the STFT matrix is the latest possible location of the Kth
%pulse which is equal to K*(N+M)+J+1
%
%We want to take the PPM matrix that contains the the time locations for
%the search if the first pulse is at n=1 and shift them to do the search if
%the first pulse arrives and n = 2,..., N+M+J+1 which is the latest
%possible location of the pulse pulse. The difference is N+M+J+1-1 = N+M+J
%This is the max number we need to add the the PPM matrix. 
%
%For the K = 1 case, the PPM is simply 1 and we add N+M+J which generates a
%Wq matrix with a dimension of 1+N+M+J. This is equivalent to the STFT
%size definition for K = 1, which is K(N+M)+J+1 = N+M+J+1, so the sizes
%will be compatible. 
%
%For the K > 1 case however the maximum element of the PPM is
%(K-1)(N+M)+J+1. Adding N+M+J to this will result in a Wq with a dimension
%of (K-1)(N+M)+J+1+N+M+J = K(N+M)+2J+1. This will be J elements larger than
%the STFT definitions of K(N+M)+J+1. This extra J comes from the fact that
%the max element of the PPM include the jitter of the final pulse and we
%also include the jitter in the shifting. Because jitter is stochastic and
%zero mean, we don't sum jitter over multiple pulses. We need to remove the
%extra jitter when shifting for K>1.

if K>1
    n_shifts = max(PRI_means_q);%Equivalent to N+M+J-J
